<u>Natural hazard management of alpine torrents</u>
</p>

<p>In a time of increasing meteorological extreme events, high-resolution terrain models are an important tool for managing natural hazards. Combining simplified models of the terrain with different spatial analysis methods, various information and parameters can be obtained, which make it easier to answer specific hydrological questions. pyAlpineRisk is a Python-based toolset that can be used in natural hazard management to support a variety of workflows. The collection of tools ranges from the first assessment of torrent catchments to the classification of torrents and the utilization of sediment material.</p>
 
 <h2>Change Detection Tool</h2>
<p> The QGIS Change Detetcion Tool(QCD) is an an open-source python-based change detection tool for raster formats designed for QGIS. The tool is used to calculate an accurate change detection by determine and visualise reliable surface- and volume changes in multi-temporal DTMs.</p> 

<h2>Installation/Application</h2>
<p>The scripts are written for PyQGIS 3.16 and can be used by installing QGIS 3.16 or above.

To install QGIS tools developed for QGIS 3.x, copy them into
~/AppData/Roaming/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/processing/scripts or in the upper part of the toolbox dialog you can add the scripts with ![mIconPythonFile](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52344347/136413201-b4a1f7d3-4053-4aa6-b11c-9433ae617057.png) Scripts - Add Script to Toolbox ...

After that the tools can be found in the QGIS "Processing Toolbox" - Scripts</p>
